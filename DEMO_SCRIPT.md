## ðŸŽ¯ Q&A Preparation

### Likely Questions & Answers

**Q: "How long did this take to build?"**
A: "About 4-5 hours total, including debugging, deployment setup, and creating multiple interfaces. The web interface alone was about 2 hours."

**Q: "What technologies did you use?"**
A: "Python Flask for the backend, SQLite for the database, Bootstrap 5 for responsive design, and ngrok for instant public deployment. All production-ready technologies."

**Q: "Could this scale to real use?"**
A: "Absolutely. It's designed with scalability in mind - SQLite handles thousands of expenses, the stateless design allows horizontal scaling, and it's ready for cloud deployment."

**Q: "What was the biggest challenge?"**
A: "A Unicode encoding issue where the 'Ã©' character in sample data caused infinite loops. This taught me about systematic debugging and character handling in Python."

**Q: "What would you add next?"**
A: "User authentication, receipt photo uploads, budget tracking with alerts, integration with bank APIs, and team sharing features. The architecture supports easy feature additions."
